## HL7 Norge - √òyvind AAssve, Sykehuspartner

Different norwegian projects

## Finland Finnish base profiles

* Snapshot and SMART implementation guide
* Based on the most common use-cases in the healthcare sector
* Most terminology is from existing codesystems
* Builds on the international IPA specification
* Take a look on the base profiles in other countries adapt what is being done in other countries
* Later this spring harmonization of the nordic base profiles

### Finnland FHIR demo

* Finnish demo site in winish [FHIR demo](fhir.fi/en/demo2022)
* Integration using FHIR is documented and tested in connectaton
* FHIR first strategy of the larges 
* Repeating the FHIR demo HIMSS event in june
* Interested parties 
* HUS has a FHIR first strategy

### Questions/comments

* Base profile use in finland?
  * Not published yet, but the reason for starting the effort is to prevent the way FHIr is implemented in different projects in implementations
* Is the government involved in profiling or mandating use of the profiles?
  * Government KELA, THL code setting, Ministry of health (not involved) but the other two are involved
* [13:21] Jens Kristian Villadsen do they have to be on the nordic market?[13:21] Jens Kristian Villadsenthe solutions?
  * No they do not
* I have a stealth project of interest :-)
* FHIR first strategy working out for HUS
  * EPIC installation using the FHIR integration, most recent 

## Denmark FUT F√¶lles underst√∏ttelse av telemedicin

* Largest FHIR implementation in Denmark
  * 89 municipalities and all four regions are connectted to FUT
* Telemedicine solutions on one common infrastructure
  * Confluence site that lists different details on arcitecture, security and 40 different FHIR profiles
  * FUT denmark
* Main arcitecture is a eHealth infrastructure, the centre of communication between ciizen, service providers and healthcare providers
* Federation portals, first system of its kind in Denmark communitaion between differnt part of the healthcare system using FHIR
  * First COPD patient yesterday
* FHIR resources - Patient, AuditEvent Appointment, Communication, Organization
* FUT and it's stack API first
  * Not a disease specific platform
  * 13 FHIr services, subset of the FHIR resources, 50 application services running
* Security model is not SMART, but SMART'ish
  * Federate different identity providers
  * Attributes for roles and assotionations in SAM
  * Access to FHIR resources is federated using role and also what care team you participate in
  * CareTeams if the actual FHIR resources referaence your CareTeam for you to have access to it
  * How do you administrate the care teams efficiently? in cooperation including caregivers from many different organizations
    * No limits to the different administrators, the organizations need to govern this themself
      * One administrator can assign their collegues
    * A true distributed model
  * Tool support for the administrators
    * SAML attribute builder
* FUT is based on FHIR started R3 converto R4
  * One IG to cover them all
  * Based on HAPI fhir implementation with a large amount of customization

### Questions/comments

* How is the SAML tool integrated with the different adminstration tools in different orgz
* What is the timeline for use FUT infrastructure
  * Municipality project are on FUT
  * First COPD patient using Questionaire and Observation

## Denmark Transisition from legacy

* EDIFACT, XML, CDA and now try to move to HL7 FHIR, messaging with HL7 FHIR
* Sundhedsdatanet - Medcom
* use-case for webservices and webservicees
* EHMI - with eDelivery 
* Test and certification of systems using standards
* Stop using danish standards - start using HL7 standards, startu using english as communication language
* Standard catalog
* Messging, including refferal hotel
* Webservice enabled - lab orders, etc
* Document sharing
  * Patient overview
  * Patient reported outcome
  * pregnancy journal
* Lessons learned so far
  * Loose coupling
  * Not a 1:1 transition to FHIR, take the use-cases more suitable for REST communication
* FHIR is recommended, but expensive to implement
  * New functionality added to the FHIR messaging spec
* New infrastructure for messaging
* Test and certification
  * more than transport, semantics and standards
* Technical integration, shared information, dialog with wendors

### Danish FHIR core profiles

* Patient, organization etc.

### Channel strategy (communication paradigm)

* Messaging, document sharing, FHIR services, Linking systems
* Sustainaility of the modernization project
  * added functionality comes at a cost
* Deloitte concluded that some messages should be exchanged with FHIR API's

### Questions

* How have you handled labratory reports that should be witheld from the patient?
  * In the lab result there are consent information
  * National service my consent - certain lab results could be witheld
* Any thougths of what use-cases are better served by REST than by the messaging paradigm? What makes the use-cases more suitable for RESTFUL API?
* but expensive to implement what drives the cost? Are FHIR the best model for message based communication? Messaging have low maturity in the FHIr standard itself

## Eventuelt og diskusjon

## Swedish Base FHIR profiles

* The details [on](hl7.se/fhir/ig/base/index.html)
* Work group from regions authorities, system vendors, Inera etc.
* Focus on profiling swedish concepts decide how the swedish specialites is done in the same way across implementation
* Problem with org and funding
* Four profiles and 3 extensions
  * Patient - Typical info from tax-agency for Patient info
  * Practititoer - swedish identifiers, qualification identifiers and some different swedish specific coding for qualification
  * Organization - Swedish 
* Use cases - Swidish medication list is one example

## National Swedish medication list

* Made by swedish health agency
* Healthcare staff and pharmacists get the same information about the prescriptions
  * External API's are FHIR based
  * on-boarding in progress
* Techincal shift from swedish specific SOAP to HL7 FHIR
* Documentation
  * Simplifier IG in english - with examples
  * Hanbook for FHIR in swedish
  * The HL7 FHIR documentation
* Advantages of using FHIR
  * Semantics - using FHIr you get a backbone structure and defintion
  * REST is a powerfull and flexible comm paradigm
  * FHIR implementation is quicker using SDK and existing tools
* The profiles are documented on SIMPLIFIER

### Questions

* Inera have provided some services - but the knowledgable persons have left the organization
* We have tried to extend the swedish base profiles when working with the industry profiles
  * Tweaking the publication process
* Swedish strategy is to get the industry to work on profiles
  * Have to find ways to work together

Regarding the Swedish base profiles: In Sweden you also have the industry initiative for the base profiles, https://build.fhir.org/ig/SvenskaIndustriProfiler/fhir/. Are the aims of the projects similar or different? Do the projects work together? (Or did they, when the HL7 Sweden project was still running?)
