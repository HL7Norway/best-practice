## Epic FHIR capabilities and global implementation experience

* Sam Echevarria working with implementation of FHIR for hospitals in the Netherlands
* Epic is a EMR supplier from the US
* Helseplattformen uses Epic
* One global codebase
* Interoperability toolkit - 
  * Messaging, API's, document sharing, workflow and data migration
* FHIR first for API development
* Query response against the database - different datapoints supported
* 1300 unique apps integrate with Epic FHIR API's 40 milliarder oppslag i året
* 400+ FHIR API's
  * Includes create and update
* JSON tech
  * OAuth 2.0 - authorization
  * SMART on FHIR - app launch framework
  * Open IDConnect - identfication
  * SMART on FHIR EHR launch framework - 
* Other uses of FHIR
  * Bulk FHIR data
  * FHIRCast - context sync - 
  * Other exchange patterns - messaging etc.
  * Based on actual use-cases 
* Open.epic.com - documentation of all FHIR API's that Epic supports
  * fhir.epic.com
  * Free sandbox for testing and development
  * System ownership

DISCLAIMER - not a development roadmap

* FHIR as the technical approach - primary
  * Modernize
  * Unify
  * Solve open needs - things not solved well today by older standards
  * Combinations
* IPA - International Patient Access
  * Patients access to patient data
  * FHIR base based on IPA
  * DK-Core considers IPA dependencies
  * Vulcan
  * Nordics on FHIR - engage in IPA work
* Incorperate IPA
  * New mechanisms
* IPS - International Patient summary
  * Perspective currently focus on IPA in Epic
* FHIR R5 - General advice
  * R4 has most support
  * R5 is currently best for greenfield development - in need of the latest updates and features
* SMART 2.0
  * security enhancements and grenular scopes
  * Smart 1 scopes: "patient/Observation.read"
  * Subresources - different kinds of Observations
    * no support for this granularity in v1
  * granular scopes with "?category=vital-signs"

## Perspective from FHIR globally

* Use the right tool for the task at hand
  * FHIR does not solve all interoperability needs
  * How to choose the right tool
* Enterprise Data warehose population
  * keep up to date on a nightlybasis
  * EDW stors data as FHIr resources
    * Not good use case
    * How to keep the data up to data up to date, FHIR Bulk could work
  * EHR <-> ordering and result
    * Existing solutions exists and works good
    * Ordering and resulting API's is not a good fit
    * existing messaging works good and does not need replacing.
* Integration design
  * Don't devlop in a vacuum
  * well behaved to consider, safety, security, privasy and reliability
* The FHIR profiling
  * Profile prolification - Data science approach
  * The profile explosion can be a problem
    * ePrescribing as example
  * Diverge as little as possible
    * example resources
    * Conformance rules
    * mustsupport /other tools in the standard
  * Artifacts - do they give enought information to implementers
    * Automated test tools
    * Realistic expectiations
      * years not months - collaboration and hard work
* A global effort
  * Needs engagement from different groups
  * Engage in HL7 Norway, nordics on fhir and hl7 int.
* 

### Questions

* Are you planning to support R5?

* Perhaps Helseplattformen could do a presentation some time about their thoughts and support for SMART-on-FHIR and we could work together to get some demos of SMART-apps in the Helseplattformen environment? 

* Can you comment on how widespread services with CDS Hooks interfaces are?
* Have you ever hit limitations of the Card structure and wished you could have more structure in the response you received? Do you have a real-world example that uses Card extensions?

* Answer: Just FYI if you want to read more about our support for that, you should be able to access this: https://vendorservices.epic.com/Article?docId=clinicaldecisionsupport
Home - Vendor Services
you do have to create a free account though

* Q: The global codebase does it cause any problems with development in different juristictions?
* Answer: Is it possible to harmonize the use cases across jurisdictions.

## FHIR in Helseplattformen

* Helseplattformen first release is mostly based on existing national standards, not much FHIR but implemented
  * SFM medication
  * helsenorgeno booking
  * ScreenIT tarmscreening
  * Implemented using biztalk integrations
* Lessons learned
  * Extensive use of extensions in some Norwegian FHIR IG's
  * Use of codesystems

* SFM - experience
  * A lot of Norwegian specific extensions - for example for defining the FEST information model
    * Examples:
      * FEST
      * Organization info
      * Allergy intolerance - timestamp information
      * SFM medication - information ends up in extensions
  * Makes re-use of code from global codebase difficult
* The definition of the coding of the medication prescribed is not well defined/precise
* Helsenorge
  * Fewer extensions
  * Needs common national work on appointment types, the codesystems used in helsenorge is not specific enough for spesialisthelsetjenesten
* ScreenIT koloskopi screening
  * Registry reporting - populating data warehouse?
  * Create a lot of extensions that makes the resources really complex
  * Probably better as a Questionnaire instead of bundled FHIR resources.
* A more successfull approach to using FHIR
  * FHIR as a standard information model
  * OMOP common data model for use in structuring research data
    * FHIR based structure?
* Adapt solutions to standard instead of standard to existing solutions
  * FHir information model is based on 30+ years of integration work
* Needs more focus on Codesets/valusets
  * needed for precision, decision support and actual interoperability
  * Use international standards when possible (SNOMED, LOINC, etc)
  * When no codesets are defined you need translation (expensive)
* A lot of international standardizations work without Norway participating (Dagens medisin)

## Q&A

* Q: Intention of SFM is to hold eResept information and also PLL including medical adverse effect and interactions. Is it possible to do a perfect mapping to FHIR, it is not greenfield.  
* A: We try to adapt FHIR to the existing information models, we might need to develop map differently or we get locked in today's information structure.
* Comment: How to move towards the international standards.
  
* Q: Mappings directly to standard FHIR medication statement - might be lossy. Would it solve some problems with interoperability and might solve implementation issues.
