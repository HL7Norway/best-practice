## Questions

Kari Heinonen (Ekstern)
I might be totally wrong, sorry, but I think recent FI eIDAS webinar mentioned something about required EU-citizen identifier (of course healthcare might be a different case) having actually encountered "resistance" at EU-level. The compromise calling for some form of "patient matching" based on name, address, birthdate etc. Which does not make any sense at all to me but hey, it's EU legislation 

* This is where legislation in different countries differ a lot, regarding identification of a Person/Patient.
  * And it's not just how patient is identified nationally but also maybe if this method is allowed to be used cross-border even if it could (technically) be ...

Mikael Rinnetmäki (Ekstern)
Regarding financial resources, in my opinion all Nordic HL7 affiliates could adopt the financial model that HL7 Finland uses, with both membership fees and project fees. HL7 Finland's project fee scales with the size of the organization (specified by amount of people involved in healthcare IT integrations). That gives the affiliate some resources that can be used to fund a FHIR ambassador and to dedicate resources to profiling work, etc.
