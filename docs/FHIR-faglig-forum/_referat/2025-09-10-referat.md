  * How EHMI embraces and enhances eDelivery with FHIR

## Terminology nordic coop

* Context and background from Mattias Colliander
* A case for term servers
  * CodeSystems, terminology and classifications
* A lot of organizations cooperate
* At some point we need to code information for interop.
* Do not build your own just don't
  * There are a lot of commercial available or open source, use that
* Term server is a Techincal issue - not ownership

* Term server - defined by FHIR in the terminology module
* How to serve concepts, codesystems and valuesets
* Production vs IG creation
  * Transactional load performance, SLA
  * Hard to deliver a stable service for production (clinical) use-case

* Creating IGs
* Readable and the national/local codesystems in our native language
* The termserver ecosstem is used for validation and expansion of national/regional/local codesystems/valuesets
* The ecosystem is built around tx.fhir.org
  * tx.fhir.org has a list of what term server has a maintained version of that codesystem
  * IG creation tooling can be used as normal, and still get national codesystems
* Started in Vitalis 2025
  * why can't you just run one
  * xyz.fhir.org
  * Broaden the scope of swedish term server to all of the nordics
* tx-nordics.fhir.org an instance of CSIRO's Ontoserver
  * HL7 Affiliate License
  * interoperability standards development
  * internal research and development
  * NOT for production systems
* Common responsibility - HL7 Sweden put it up
  * Maintained by the nordic HL7 affiliates
  * Documented on HL7.or confluence (hl7 nordics)
* References and documentation
  * (should be published on confluence)

## Technical implementation and demo (Vadim Peretokin)

* Hosted in the cloud Cleura
* Open stack

* Can be accessed on the [internet](https://tx-nordics.fhir.org/fhir/r4)
* Dashboard  
  * Resources
  * Terminology resources
    * Valuesets, codesystems and namingsystems
    * SNOMED editions from the nordics
  * ConformanceResource
    * operations
    * resources supported
  * Use the FHIR API of the server
    * CSIRO have a postman [collection](https://www.postman.com/jimsteel/ontoserver/collection/k4gv6q6/ontoserver-6-example-fhir-terminology-requests?action=share&creator=317818)
  * Terminology browser Shrimp
    * Translations are provided with the national editions
    * Search for abbreviations of words
  * ECL works on ontoserver
  * Building IG's from the tx-nordic
  * Not for runtime use - you should syndicate to a local tx-server
  
## Whats next for nordic coop - Daniel Karlsson

* What to use this terminology server for?
* Use-cases
  * Publishing validationg FHIR IGs in the nordic countries
  * Publishing codsystems in our FHIR IG's not readily avilable in FHIR format
    * NPU etc.
  * publishing translations fo HL7 and other codesystems
  * Codesystem maintenance and development (through IG's)
    * can be uploaded to the terminology server
* In the end we might not have to specify using the tx-nordic switch set when terminology nordic is recognized in the ecosystem
* Pulbication of FHIR IG says that missing codesystems leads to an expansion error in IG building.
* Responsibility to keep this updated with latest version
* Work with terminology provider to decide on FHIR representation
* Governance of the terminology server have to be decided.
* NPU terminology on FHIR
  * Will be published on tx-nordics
* multi language IG's
  * Tooling in development

### Q and A

* Inspiring work, would like to cooperate on updates of the Norwegian edition.
  * SNOMED edtions plans to add support for participate in the ecosystem
  * To host the nordic editions
  * Syndication to the SNOMED CT update feed can be set up
